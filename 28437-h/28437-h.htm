<p><span class="dcap">Know him?</span></p>

<p>Well you might say I practically
grew up with him. He
was my hero in those days. I
thought few wiser or greater
men ever lived. In my eyes he
was greater than Babe Ruth,
Lindy, or the President.</p>

<p>Of course, time, and my
growing up caused me to
bring him into a perspective
that I felt to be more consonant
with his true position in
his field of endeavor. When
he died his friends mourned
for fond remembrance of
things past, but privately
many of them felt that he had
outlived his best days. Now
with this glorious vindication,
I wonder how many of them
are still alive to feel the
twinge of conscience....</p>

<p>Oh, we're delighted of
course, but it seems incredible
even today to us elated oldsters.
Although we were always
his staunchest admirers,
in retrospect we can see now
that no one believed more
than we that he did it strictly
for the dollar. It is likely
there was always a small
corps of starry-eyed adolescents
who found the whole
improbable saga entirely believable,
or at least half believed
it might be partly true.
The attitude of the rest of us
ranged from a patronizing
disparagement that we thought
was expected of us, through
grudging admiration, to out-and-out
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Certainly if anybody had
taken the trouble to consider
it&mdash;and why should they
have?&mdash;the landing of the
first manned ship on our
satellite seemed to render
him as obsolete as a horde of
other lesser and even greater
lights. At any rate, it was
inevitable that the conquest
of the moon would be merely
a stepping-stone to more distant
points.</p>

<p>Oh, no, I had nothing to do
with the selection of the Red
Planet. Coming in as head of
Project P-4 in its latter
stages, as I did when Dr.
Fredericks died, the selection
had already been made. Yes,
it's quite likely I may have
been plugging for Mars below
the conscious level. A combination
of chance, expediency
and popular demand made
Mars the next target, rather
than Venus, which was, in
some ways, the more logical
goal. I would have given anything
to have gone, but the
metaphorical stout heart that
one reporter once credited me
with is not the same as an old
man's actual fatty heart.</p>

<p>And there were heartbreak
years ahead before the <i>Goddard</i>
was finally ready. During
this time he slipped further
into obscurity while big,
important things were happening
all around us. You're
right, that one really big creation
of his <i>is</i> bigger than
ever. It has passed into the
language, and meant employment
for thousands of people.
Too few of them have even
heard of him. Of course, he
was still known and welcomed
by a small circle of acquaintances,
but to the world at
large he was truly a "forgotten
man."</p>

<p>It is worthy of note that
one of the oldest of these acquaintances
was present at
blast-off time. He happened
to be the grandfather of a certain
competent young crewman.
The old man was a proud
figure during the brief ceremonies
and his eyes filled
with tears as the mighty
rocket climbed straight up on
its fiery tail. He remained
there gazing up at the sky
long after it had vanished.</p>

<p>He was heard to murmur,
"I am glad the kid could go,
but it is just a lark to him. He
never had a 'sense of wonder.'
How could he&mdash;nobody
reads anymore."</p>

<p>Afterward, his senile emotions
betraying him, he broke
down completely and had to
be led from the field. It is rumored
he did not live long after
that.</p>

<p>The <i>Goddard</i> drove on until
Mars filled the viz-screen. It
was planned to make at least
a half-dozen braking passes
around the planet for observational
purposes before the
actual business of bringing
the ship in for landfall began.
As expected the atmosphere
proved to be thin. The
speculated dead-sea areas,
oddly enough, turned out to
be just that. To the surprise
of some, it was soon evident
that Mars possessed, or had
possessed, a high civilization.
The <i>canali</i> of Schiaparelli
were indeed broad waterways
stretching from pole to pole,
too regular to be anything but
the work of intelligence. But
most wonderful of all were
the scattered, but fairly numerous
large, walled cities
that dotted the world. Everybody
was excited, eager to
land and start exercising their
specialties.</p>

<p>One of the largest of these
cities was selected more or
less at random. It was decided
to set down just outside,
yet far enough from the walls
to avoid any possibility of
damage from the landing jets
in the event the city was inhabited.
Even if deserted, the
entire scientific personnel
would have raised a howl that
would have been heard back
on Earth if just a section of
wall was scorched. When
planet-fall was completed and
observers had time to scan
the surroundings it was seen
that the city was very much
alive.</p>

<p>"What keeps them up!"
marvelled Kopchainski, the
aeronautics and rocketry authority.</p>

<p>The sky swarmed with
ships of strange design. The
walls were crowded with inhabitants,
too far away for detailed
observation. Even as
they looked an enormous gate
opened and a procession of
mounted figures emerged. In
the event the place was deserted,
the Captain would have
had the honor of being the
first to touch Martian soil.
While atmospheric and other
checks were being run, he
gave orders for the previously
decided alternative. Captain,
semanticist and anthropologist
would make the First
Contact.</p>

<p>With all checks agreeing
that it was safe to open locks,
soon the three representatives
of Earth were walking
shoulder to shoulder down
the ramp. It was apparent that
the two scientists purposely
missed stride inches from the
end, so that it was the Captain's
foot that actually
touched ground first.</p>

<p>The cavalcade&mdash;though
these beasties were certainly
not horses&mdash;was now near
enough to the ship for details
to be seen. Surprise and wonderment
filled the crew, for
while the multi-legged steeds
were as alien as anyone might
expect to find on an alien
world, the riders were very
definitely humanoid. Briefly,
brightly and barbarically
trapped as they were by
earthly standards, they
seemed to be little distinguishable
from homegrown
homo saps.</p>

<p>The approaching company
appeared to be armed mainly
with swords and lances, but
also in evidence were some tubular
affairs that could very
well be some sort of projectile-discharging
device. The Captain
suddenly felt unaccountably
warm. It was a heavy responsibility&mdash;he
hoped these
Martians wouldn't be the
type of madmen who believed
in the "shoot first, inquire
later" theory.</p>

<p>Even as he stood there, outwardly
calm but jittering internally,
the Martian riders
pulled up ten feet from the
Earthmen. Their leader, tall,
dark-haired, and subtly lighter
in hue than his companions,
dismounted and approached
the Captain. With outstretched
hand he took the
Captain's in a firm grip.</p>

<p>Let it be recorded here, to
the shame of an Earth where
reading for pleasure is virtually
a lost pastime, that not
one man on the <i>Goddard</i> realized
the significance of what
followed.</p>

<p>"How do you do?" he said
in perfect English, with an
unmistakable trace of Southern
accent.</p>

<p>"Welcome to Barsoom! My
name is John Carter."</p>
